## notes
- TS needs to be compiled into JS so browsers and other systems can read it 
- TS annotation tells data what type it is. TS will throw an error if the data entered is not similar to the annotation (see line 9 in .ts)
- TS error gives the file name and the line/column number which it occurs and descrption of error.
