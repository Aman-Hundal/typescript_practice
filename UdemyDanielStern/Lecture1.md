## notes
- new language create from microsoft
- compiled into JS
- similar to JS syntax (yay)
- you can integrate typescript into JS without need to convert entire projects in TS
- used in Angular.JS and in Win.JS
- Why TS?
 - prevents bugs. JS is dynamic and can lead to bugs often
 - with TS you can lock vars to a type/condition (like string or number)
 - contains classes and modules
 - integrates with Gulp and Grunt (reduces any compilation tasks)
 - TS is great for large JS projects and longterm maintenance (enforcement of types and gives access to easy to manage clases)
